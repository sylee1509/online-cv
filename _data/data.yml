    title: Profile
    summary: |
      I am an integrated M.S./Ph.D. student in Industrial & Management Engineering at POSTECH with a focus on combinatorial optimization, including vehicle routing problems, logistics, facility location, and machine scheduling. 
      To facilitate my research, I employ various methodologies, including but not limited to integer programming, (meta) heuristics, and hybridization with artificial intelligence.
      I am open to collaborating with good research partners, so please don't hesitate to contact me. :)
